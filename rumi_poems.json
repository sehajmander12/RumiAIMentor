    "chapter_title": "The Tavern: Whoever Brought Me Here Will Have to Take Me Home",
    "chapter_intro": "In the tavern are many wines-the wine of delight in color and form\n\nand taste, the wine of the intellect's agility, the fine port of stories, and\n\nthe cabernet of soul singing. Being human means entering this place\n\nwhere entrancing varieties of desire are served. The grapeskin of ego\n\nbreaks and a pouring begins. Fermentation is one of the oldest sym-\n\nbols for human transformation. When grapes combine their juice and\n\nare closed up together for a time in a dark place, the results are spec-\n\ntacular. This is what lets two drunks meet so that they don't know\n\nwho is who. Pronouns no longer apply in the tavern's mud-world of\n\nexcited confusion and half-articulatedw antings.\n\nBut after some time in the tavern, a point comes, a memory of else-\n\nwhere, a longing for the source, and the drunks must set off from the\n\ntavern and begin the return. The Qur'an says, \"We are all returning.\"\n\nThe tavern is a kind of glorious hell that human beings enjoy and suf-\n\nfer and then push off from in their search for truth. The tavern is a\n\ndangerous region where sometimes disguises are necessary, but never\n\nhide your heart, Rumi urges. Keep open there. A breaking apart, a\n\ncrying out into the street, begins in the tavern, and the human soul\n\nturns to find its way home.\n\nIt's 4 A.M. Nasruddin leaves the tavern and walks the town\n\naimlessly. A policeman stops him. \"Why are you out wandering\n\nthe streets in the middle of the night?\" \"Sir,\" replies Nasruddin,\n\n\"if I knew the answer to that question, I would have been home\n\nhours ago!\"",

Rumi's variation on this is\n\nto refer instead to Shams (over a thousand poems end this way) or to\n\nsilence. He gives the poetry to its true authorship, including the\n\nemptiness after as part of the poem. Five hundred odes conclude with\n\nkhamush, silence. Rumi is less interested in language, more attuned to\n\nthe sources of it. He keeps asking Husam, \"Who's making this\n\nmusic?\" He sometimes gives the wording over to the invisible flute\n\nplayer: \"Let that musician finish this poem.\" Words are not impor-\n\ntant in themselves, but as resonators for a center. Rumi has a whole\n\ntheory of language based on the reed flute (ney) Beneath everything\n\nwe say, and within each note of the reed flute, lies a nostalgia for the\n\nreed bed. Language and music are possible only because we're empty,\n\nhollow, and separated from the source. All language is a longing for\n\nhome.

Their hope, though,\n\nis for emptiness, so don't think\n\nyou must avoid it.

You're the companion\n\nof an emperor! The entire nation is ranged out\n\nbefore you like stars that you can command!\"\n\nThe young man replied, \"I am remembering\n\nmy mother and my father, and how they\n\nscared me as a child with threats of you!\n\n'Uh-oh, he's headed for King Mahmud's court!\n\nNothing could be more hellish!'

We have no water jug.\n\nWe barely have any clothes. No blankets\n\nfor the night. We fantasize that the full moon\n\nis a cake. We reach for it! We're an embarrassment\n\neven to the beggars. Everyone avoids us.\n\nArab men are supposed to be generous warriors,\n\nbut look at you, stumbling around! If some guest\n\nwere to come to us, we'd steal his rags\n\nwhen he fell asleep. Who is your guide\n\nthat leads you to this? We can't even get\n\na handful of lentils! Ten years' worth\n\nof nothing, that's what we are!\"\n\nShe went on and on.\n\n\"If God is abundant, we must be following\n\nan imposter. Who's leading us? Some fake,\n\nthat always says, Tomorrow, illumination\n\nwill bring you treasure, tomorrow.\n\nAs everyone knows, that never comes.\n\nThough I guess, it happens very rarely, sometimes,\n\nthat a disciple following an vmposter can somehow\n\nsurpass the pretender. But still I want to know\n\nwhat this deprivation says about us.\"\n\nThe husband replied, finally,\n\n\"How long will you complain\n\nabout money and our prospects for money? The torrent\n\nof our life has mostly gone by. Don't worry about\n\ntransient things. Think how the animals live.\n\nThe dove on the branch giving thanks.\n\nThe glorious singing of the nightingale.\n\nThe gnat. The elephant. Every living thing\n\ntrusts in God for its nourishment.\n\nThese pains that you feel are messengers.\n\nListen to them. Turn them to sweetness. The night\n\nis almost over. You were young once, and content.\n\nNow you think about money all the time.\n\nYou used to be that money. You were a healthy vine.\n\nNow you're a rotten fruit. You ought to be growing\n\nsweeter and sweeter, but you've gone bad.\n\nAs my wife, you should be equal to me.\n\nLike a pair of boots, if one is too tight,\n\nthe pair is of no use.\n\nLike two folding doors, we can't be mismatched.\n\nA lion does not mate with a wolf.\"\n\nSo this man who was happily poor\n\nscolded his wife until daybreak,\n\nwhen she responded,\n\n\"Don't talk to me\n\nabout your high station! Look how you act!\n\nSpiritual arrogance is the ugliest of all things.\n\nIt's like a day that's cold and snowy,\n\nand your clothes are wet too!\n\nIt's too much to bear!\n\nAnd don't call me your mate, you fraud!\n\nYou scramble after scraps of bone\n\nwith the dogs.\n\nYou're not as satisfied as you pretend!\n\nYou're the snake and the snake charmer\n\nat the same time, but you don't know it.\n\nYou're charming a snake for money,\n\nand the snake is charming you.\n\nYou talk about God a lot, and you make me feel guilty\n\nby using that word. You better watch out!\n\nThat word will poison you, if you use it\n\nto have power over me.\"\n\nSo the rough volume of her talking\n\nfell on the husband, and he fought back,\n\n\"Woman,\n\nthis poverty is my deepest joy.\n\nThis bare way of life is honest and beautiful.\n\nWe can hide nothing when we're like this.\n\nYou say I'm really arrogant and greedy,\n\nand you say I'm a snake charmer and a snake,\n\nbut those nicknames are for you.\n\nIn your anger and your wantings\n\nyou see those qualities in me.\n\nI want nothing from this world.\n\nYou're like a child that has turned round and round,\n\nand now you think the house is turning.\n\nIt's your eyes that see wrong.

    "chapter_intro": "Sufis call the wantings nafs. From the urgent way lovers want each\n\nother to the sannyasin's search for truth, all moving is from the\n\nmover. Every pull draws us to the ocean. Rumi says it's important to\n\nlive the wantings as they come and not get stuck somewhere, stag-\n\nnant. He was asked once what tr do about a young man caught doing\n\nsome indecent act. The story doesn't mention what exactly-mastur-\n\nbation, peeping-tomming, whatever wild wantings young men think\n\nto do. Rumi told them not to worry about it. \"It just means he's\n\ngrowing his feathers. The dangerous case is a kid who doesn't do in-\n\ndecent acts, who then leaves the nest without feathers. One flap and\n\nthe cat has him. \" Be careful, Rumi suggests, about shaming sexual be-\n\nhavior in an adolescent or anyone who hasn't yet had his or her fill of\n\nerotic trancing. Often, the closest we come to surrender is orgasm. In\n\nRumi's symbology the rooster is a symbol for that energy.\n\nSo how did Husam kill his rooster? By dissolving into the play.\n\nThe nafs are energies that keep us moving, stopping nowhere. Union\n\nwith the divine continually unfolds. Next to the glowing drive-in\n\nmovie, the junkyard's rusted stacks of old desire-bodies. Let the\n\nbeauty we love keep turning into action, transmuting to another, an-\n\nother. What have I ever lost by dying? Rumi asks, exchanging one set\n\nof nafs for the next. Chopped rooster energy becomes another dining\n\nroom story. Particles of praise shine in the sunlight. Anything you\n\ngrab hold of on the bank breaks with the river's pressure. When you\n\ndo things from your soul, the river itself moves through you. Fresh-\n\nness and a deep joy are signs of the current.",

The siege goes on for a week,\n\nwith many casualties, the walls and the towers unsteady,\n\nas soft as wax. The King of Mosul sends an envoy.\n\n\"Why this killing? If you want the city,\n\nI will leave and you can have it!\n\nIf you want more wealth, that's even easier.\"\n\nThe captain takes out the piece of paper\n\nwith the girl's picture on it. This.\n\nThe strong King of Mosul is quick to reply.\n\n\"Lead her out. The idol belongs with the idolater.\"\n\nWhen the captain sees her, he falls in love\n\nlike the Caliph. Don't laugh at this.\n\nThis loving is also part of infinite love,\n\nwithout which the world does not evolve.\n\nObjects move from inorganic to vegetation\n\nto selves endowed with spirit through the urgency\n\nof every love that wants to come to perfection.\n\nThis captain thinks the soil looks fertile,\n\nso he sows his seed. Sleeping, he sees the girl\n\nin a dream. He makes love to her image,\n\nand his semen spurts out.\n\nAfter a while he begins to wake.\n\nSlowly he senses the girl is not there.\n\n\"I have given my seed into nothing.\n\nI shall put this tricky woman to a test.\"\n\nA leader who is not captain of his body is not one\n\nto be honored, with his semen spilled so in the sand.\n\nNow he loses all control. He doesn't care\n\nabout the Caliph, or about dymg.\n\n\"I am in love,\" he says.\n\nDo not act in such heat.\n\nTake counsel with a master.\n\nBut the captain couldn't.\n\nHis infatuation is a blackwater wave carrying him away.\n\nSomething that doesn't exist makes a phantom\n\nappear in the darkness of a well,\n\nand the phantom itself becomes strong enough\n\nto throw actual lions into the hole.\n\nMore advice: it is dangerous to let other men\n\nhave intimate connections with the women in your care.\n\nCotton and fire sparks, those are, together.\n\nDifficult, almost impossible, to quernh.\n\nThe captain does not return straight to the Caliph,\n\nbut instead camps in a secluded meadow.\n\nBlazing, he can't tell ground from sky.\n\nHis reason is lost in a drumming sound,\n\nworthless radish and son of a radish.\n\nThe Caliph himself a gnat, nothing.\n\nBut just as this cultivator tears off the woman's pants\n\nand lies down between her legs, his penis moving\n\nstraight to the mark, there's a great tumult\n\nand a rising cry of soldiers outside the tent.\n\nHe leaps up with his bare bottom shining\n\nand runs out, scimitar in hand.\n\nA black lion from a nearby swamp\n\nhas gotten in among the horses. Chaos.\n\nThe lion jumping twenty feet in the air,\n\ntents billowing like an ocean.\n\nThe captain quickly approaches the lion,\n\nsplits his head with one blow,\n\nand now he's running back to the woman's tent.\n\nWhen he stretches out her beauty again,\n\nhis penis goes even more erect.\n\nThe engagement, the coming together, is as with the lion.\n\nHis penis stays erect all through it,\n\nand it does not scatter semen feebly.\n\nThe beautiful one is amazed at his virility.\n\nImmediately, with great energy she joins with his energy,\n\nand their two spirits go out from them as one.\n\nWhenever two are linked this way, there comes another\n\nfrom the unseen world. It may be through birth,\n\nif nothing prevents conception,\n\nbut a third does come, when two unite in love,\n\nor in hate. The intense qualities born\n\nof such joining appear in the spiritual world.\n\nYou will recognize them when you go there.\n\nYour associations bear progeny.\n\nBe careful, therefore. Wait, and be conscious,\n\nbefore you go to meet anyone.\n\nRemember there are children to consider!\n\nChildren you must live with and tend to,\n\nborn of your emotions with another, entities\n\nwith a form, and speech, and a place to live.\n\nThey are crying to you even now.\n\nYou have forgotten us. Come back.\n\nBe aware of this. A man and a woman together\n\nalways have a spiritual result.\n\nThe captain was not so aware. He fell,\n\nand stuck like a gnat in a pot of buttermilk,\n\ntotally absorbed in his love affair. Then,\n\njust as suddenly, he's uninterested. He tells\n\nthe woman, \"Don't say a word of this to the Caliph.\"\n\nHe takes her there, and the Caliph is smitten.\n\nShe's a hundred times more beautiful than he's imagined.\n\nA certain man asks an eloquent teacher,\n\n\"What is true and what false?\" \"This is false:\n\na bat hides from the sun, not from the idea of the sun.\n\nIt's the idea that puts fear in the bat and leads it\n\ndeeper into the cave. You have an idea\n\nof an enemy that attaches you to certain companions.\n\nMoses, the inner light of revelation,\n\nlit up the top of Sinai, but the mountain\n\ncould not hold that light.\n\nDon't deceive yourself that way!\n\nHaving the idea is not living\n\nthe reality, of anything.\n\nThere's no courage in the idea of battle.\n\nThe bathhouse wall is covered with pictures\n\nand much talk of heroism. Try to make an idea move\n\nfrom ear to eye. Then your woolly ears\n\nbecome as subtle as fibers of light.\n\nYour whole body becomes a mirror,\n\nall eye and spiritual breathing.\n\nLet your ear lead you to your lover.\"\n\nSo the Caliph is mightily in love with this girl.\n\nHis kingdom vanishes like lightning.\n\nIf your loving is numb, know this: when what you own\n\ncan vanish, it's only a dream, a vanity, breath\n\nthrough a mustache. It would have killed you.\n\nThere are those that say, \"Nothing lasts.\"\n\nThey're wrong. Every moment they say,\n\n\"If there were some other reality,\n\nI would have seen it.

Moses at first\n\nsaw only a wooden staff, but to his other seeing\n\nit was a viper and a cause of panic.\n\nEyesight is in conflict with inner knowing.\n\nMoses' hand is a hand and a source of light.\n\nThese matters are as real as the infinite is real,\n\nbut they seem religious fantasies to some,\n\nto those who believe only in the reality\n\nof the sexual organs and the digestive tract.\n\nDon't mention the Friend to those.\n\nTo others, sex and hunger are fading images,\n\nand the Friend is more constantly, solidly here.\n\nLet the former go to their church, and we'll go to ours.\n\nDon't talk long to skeptics or to those\n\nwho claim to be atheists.\n\nSo the Caliph has the idea\n\nof entering the beautiful woman,\n\nand he comes to her to do his wanting.\n\nMemory raises his penis, straining it in thought\n\ntoward the pushing down and the lifting up\n\nwhich make that member grow large with delight.\n\nBut as he actually lies down with the woman,\n\nthere comes to him a decree from God\n\nto stop these voluptuous doings. A very tiny sound,\n\nlike a mouse might make. The penis droops,\n\nand desire slips away.\n\nHe thinks that whispering sound is a snake\n\nrising off the straw mat. The girl sees his drooping\n\nand sails into fits of laughing at the marvelous thing.\n\nShe remembers the captain killing the lion\n\nwith his penis standing straight up.\n\nLong and loud her laughter.\n\nAnything she thinks of only increases it,\n\nlike the laughter of those who eat hashish.\n\nEverything is funny.\n\nEvery emotion has a source and a key that opens it.\n\nThe Caliph is furious. He draws his sword.\n\n\"What's so amusing? Tell me everything you're thinking.\n\nDon't hold anything back. At this moment\n\nI'm clairvoyant. If you lie, I'll behead you.\n\nIf you tell the truth, I'll give you your freedom.\"\n\nHe stacks seven Qur'ans on top of each other\n\nand swears to do as he says.\n\nWhen she finally gets hold of herself,\n\nthe girl tells all, in great detail. Of the camp\n\nin the meadow, the killing of the lion,\n\nthe captain's return to the tent with his penis\n\nstill hard as the horn of a rhino.\n\nAnd the contrast with the Caliph's own member\n\nsinking down because of one mouse-whisper.\n\nHidden things always come to light.\n\nDo not sow bad seed. Be sure, they'll come up.\n\nRain and the sun's heat make them rise into the air.\n\nSpring comes after the fall of the leaves,\n\nwhich is proof enough of the fact of resurrection.\n\nSecrets come out in Spring, out from earth-lips into leaf.\n\nWorries become wine-headaches.\n\nBut where did the wine come from? Think.\n\nA branch of blossoms does not look like seed.\n\nA man does not resemble semen. Jesus came\n\nfrom Gabriel's breath, but he is not in that form.\n\nThe grape doesn't look like the vine.\n\nLoving actions are the seed of something\n\ncompletely different, a living-place.\n\nNo origin is like where it leads to.\n\nWe can't know where our pain is from.\n\nWe don't know all that we've done.\n\nPerhaps it's best that we don't.\n\nNevertheless we suffer for it.\n\nThe Caliph comes back to his clarity. \"In the pride\n\nof my power I took this woman from another,\n\nso of course, someone came to knock on my door.\n\nWhoever commits adultery is a pimp\n\nfor his own wife.\n\nIf you cause injury to someone, you draw\n\nthat same injury toward yourself. My treachery\n\nmade my friend a traitor to me. This repetition\n\nmust stop somewhere. Here, in an act of mercy.\n\nI'll send you back to the captain,\n\nsaying another of my wives is jealous,\n\nand since the captain was brave enough\n\nto bring you back from Mosul,\n\nhe shall have you in marriage.\"\n\nThis is the virility of a prophet.\n\nThe Caliph was sexually impotent,\n\nbut his manliness was most powerful.\n\nThe kernel of true manhood is the ability\n\nto abandon sensual indulgences. The intensity\n\nof the captain's libido is less than a husk\n\ncompared to the Caliph's nobility in ending\n\nthe cycle of sowing lust and reaping\n\nsecrecy and vengefulness."

Don't bore mouse holes\n\nin the ground, arguing inside some\n\ndoctrinal labyrinth.\n\nThat intellectual warp and woof keeps you wrapped\n\nin blindness. And four other characteristics\n\nkeep you from loving. The Qur'an calls them\n\nfour birds. Say Bismillah, \"In the name of God,\"\n\nand chop the heads off those mischief-birds.\n\nThe rooster of lust, the peacock of wanting\n\nto be famous, the crow of ownership, and the duck\n\nof urgency, kill them and revive them\n\nin another form, changed and harmless.\n\nThere is a duck inside you.\n\nHer bill is never still, searching through dry\n\nand wet alike, like the robber In an empty house\n\ncramming objects in his sack, pearls, chickpeas,\n\nanything. Always thinking, \"There's no time!\n\nI won't get another chance!\"\n\nA True Person is more calm and deliberate.\n\nHe or she doesn't worry about interruptions.\n\nBut that duck is so afraid of missing out\n\nthat it's lost all generosity, and frighteningly expanded\n\nits capacity to take in food.\n\nA large group of unbelievers\n\nonce came to see Muhammad,\n\nknowing he would feed them.\n\nMuhammad told his friends,\n\n\"Divide these guests among you and tend to them.\n\nSince you are all filled with me,\n\nit will be as though I am the host.\"\n\nEach friend of Muhammad chose a guest,\n\nbut there was one huge person left behind.\n\nHe sat in the entrance of the mosque\n\nlike thick dregs in a cup.\n\nSo Muhammad invited the man to his own household,\n\nwhere the enormous son of a Ghuzz Turk ate everything,\n\nthe milk of seven goats and enough food\n\nfor eighteen people!\n\nThe others in the house were furious.\n\nWhen the man went to bed, the maid slammed the door\n\nbehind him and chained it shut, out of meanness\n\nand resentment. Around midnight, the man\n\nfelt several strong urges at once.\n\nBut the door! He works it,\n\nputs a blade through the crack. Nothing.\n\nThe urgency increases. The room contracts.\n\nHe falls back into a confused sleep and dreams\n\nof a desolate place, since he himself is\n\nsuch a desolate place.\n\nSo, dreaming he's by himself,\n\nhe squeezes out a huge amount,\n\nand another huge amount.\n\nBut he soon becomes conscious enough\n\nto know that the covers he gathers around him\n\nare full of shit. He shakes with spasms of the shame\n\nthat usually keeps men from doing such things.\n\nHe thinks, \"My sleep is worse than my being awake.\n\nThe waking is just full of food.\n\nMy sleep is all this.\"\n\nNow he's crying, bitterly embarrassed,\n\nwaiting for dawn and the noise of the door opening,\n\nhoping that somehow he can get out\n\nwithout anyone seeing him as he is.\n\nI'll shorten it. The door opens. He's saved.\n\nMuhammad comes at dawn. He opens the door\n\nand becomes invisible so the man won't feel ashamed,\n\nso he can escape and wash himself\n\nand not have to face the door-opener.\n\nSomeone completely absorbed in Allah like Muhammad\n\ncan do this. Muhammad had seen all that went on\n\nin the night, but he held back from letting the man out,\n\nuntil all happened as it needed to happen.\n\nMany actions which seem cruel\n\nare from a deep friendship.\n\nMany demolitions are actually renovations.\n\nLater, a meddlesome servant\n\nbrought Muhammad the bedclothes.\n\n\"Look what your guest has done!\"\n\nMuhammad smiles, himself a mercy given to all beings,\n\n\"Bring me a bucket of water.\"\n\nEveryone jumps up, \"No! Let us do this.\n\nWe live to serve you, and this is the kind of hand-work\n\nwe can do. Yours is the inner heart-work.\"\n\n\"I know that, but this is an extraordinary occasion.\"\n\nA voice inside him is saying, \"There is great wisdom\n\nin washing these bedclothes. Wash them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the man who soiled the covers and fled\n\nis returning to Muhammad's house. He has left behind\n\nan amulet that he always carried.\n\nHe enters and sees the hands of God\n\nwashing his incredibly dirty linen.\n\nHe forgets the amulet. A great love suddenly enters him.\n\nHe tears his shirt open. He strikes his head\n\nagainst the wall and the door. Blood\n\npours from his nose.\n\nPeople come from other parts of the house.\n\nHe's shrieking, \"Stay away!\"\n\nHe hits his head, \"I have no understanding!\"\n\nHe prostrates himself before Muhammad.\n\n\"You are the whole. I am a despicable, tiny,\n\nmeaningless piece. I can't look at you.\"\n\nHe's quiet and quivering with remorse.\n\nMuhammad bends over and holds him and caresses him\n\nand opens his inner knowing.\n\nThe cloud weeps, and then the garden sprouts.\n\nThe baby cries, and the mother's milk flows.\n\nThe nurse of creation has said, Let them cry a lot.\n\nThis rain-weeping and sun-burning twine together\n\nto make us grow. Keep your intelligence white-hot\n\nand your grief glistening, so your life will stay fresh.\n\nCry easily like a little child.\n\nLet body needs dwindle and soul decisions increase.\n\nDiminish what you give your physical self.\n\nYour spiritual eye will begin to open.\n\nWhen the body empties and stays empty,\n\nGod fills it with musk and mother-of-pearl.\n\nThat way a man gives his dung and gets purity.\n\nListen to the prophets, not to some adolescent boy.\n\nThe foundation and the walls of the spiritual life\n\nare made of self-denials and disciplines.\n\nStay with friends who support you in these.\n\nTalk with them about sacred texts,\n\nand how you're doing, and how they're doing,\n\nand keep your practices together."

The outer conversa-\n\ntions are contained within quotation marks, and the inner ones are\n\ncontinuous and permeate the entire fabric of his poetry. On the most\n\nordinary level, we all sometimes hear ourselves speaking from, say,\n\nsome habitualp attern of meanness or acceptable optimism; then at\n\nother times we surprise ourselves by coming out with wisdom beyond\n\nour usual. There's a modulation between realities. This is similar to\n\nwhat happens with the fluid pronoun in Rumi's poetry. The you and I\n\nare sometimes the lover talking to the beloved, the personal self and a\n\nwithout-form presence within and beyond the senses. Yet sometimes\n\nthat presence, amazingly, speaks to Rumi through the poetry; voices\n\nslide back and forth within the same short poem! Often the poem\n\nserves as a slippery doorsill place between the two, \"partly in my self\n\nand partly outside,\" the voices coming from a between-place. This ex-\n\npanding and contracting of identity is one of the exciting aspects of\n\nRumi's art. Everything is conversation.\n\nHuman beings are discourse. That flowing moves through you\n\nwhether you say anything or not. Everything that happens is filled\n\nwith pleasure and warmth because of the delight of the discourse\n\nthat's always going on.\n\n\n\nRumi's poetry mirrors back to us this ocean of woven speech too in-\n\ntricate and dynamic for any grammariant o untangle.",

Sometimes it's one who can see.\n\nA holy one does sometimes fall,\n\nbut by that tribulation, he or she ascends,\n\nescapes many illusions, escapes\n\nconventional religion, escapes\n\nbeing so bound to phenomena.\n\nThink of how PHENOMENA come trooping\n\nout of the desert of non-existence\n\ninto this materiality.\n\nMorning and night,\n\nthey arrive in a long line and take over\n\nfrom each other, \"It's my turn now.

Come into me and don't mind the sparks.\n\nIf you are a friend of God, fire is your water.\n\nYou should wish to have a hundred thousand sets of mothwings,\n\nso you could burn them away, one set a night.\n\nThe moth sees light and goes into fire. You should see fire\n\nand go toward light. Fire is what of God is world-consuming.\n\nWater, world-protecting.\n\nSomehow each gives the appearance of the other. To these eyes\n\nyou have now, what looks like water\n\nburns. What looks like fire\n\nis a great relief to be inside.\n\nYou've seen a magician make a bowl of rice\n\nseem a dish full of tiny, live worms.\n\nBefore an assembly with one breath he made the floor swarm\n\nwith scorpions that weren't there.\n\nHow much more amazing God's tricks.\n\nGeneration after generation lies down, defeated, they think,\n\nbut they're like a woman underneath a man, circling him.\n\nOne molecule-mote-second thinking of God's reversal\n\nof comfort and pain is better\n\nthan any attending ritual. That splinter\n\nof intelligence is substance.\n\nThe fire and water themselves\n\naccidental, done with mirrors."

Art\n\ngives a teasing taste of surrender without the full experience. Beauti-\n\nful poetry can keep one on the verge of the oceanic annihilation in\n\nGod. Rumi says, we've been walking in the surf holding our robes up,\n\nwhen we should be diving naked under, and deeper under.",

        "poem": "The harper had grown old. I lis voice was choked sounding\n\nand harsh, and some of his harp strings were broken.\n\nHe went to the graveyard at Medina and wept. \"Lord,\n\nyou've always accepted counterfeit coins from me!\n\nTake these prayers again, and give me enough\n\nto buy new silk strings for my harp.\"\n\nHe put the harp down for a pillow and went to sleep.\n\nThe bird of his soul escaped! Free of the body\n\nand the grieving, flying in a vast simple region\n\nthat was itself, where it could sing its truth.\n\n\"I love this having no head, this tasting without mouth,\n\nthis memory without regret, how without hands I gather\n\nrose and basil on an infinitely stretching-out plain\n\nthat is my joy.\" So this waterbird plunged into its ocean,\n\nJob's fountain where Job was healed of all afflictions,\n\nthe pure sunrise. If this Mathnawi were suddenly sky,\n\nit could not hold half the mystery that this old poet\n\nwas enjoying in sleep. If there were a clear way\n\ninto that, no one would stay here!\n\nThe Caliph Omar, meanwhile, was napping nearby,\n\nand a voice came, \"Give seven hundred gold dinars\n\nto the man sleeping in the cemetery.\"\n\nEveryone understands this voice when it comes.\n\nIt speaks with the same authority to Turk and Kurd,\n\nPersian, Arab, Ethiopian, one language!\n\nOmar went to the place and sat by the sleeping man.\n\nOmar sneezed, and the poet sprang up thinking\n\nthis great man was there to accuse him.\n\n\"No. Sit here beside me. I have a secret to tell you.\n\nThere is gold enough in this sack to buy new silk\n\nstrings for your instrument. Take it,\n\nbuy them, and come back here.\"\n\nThe old poet heard and realized the generosity\n\nthat had come. He threw the harp on the ground\n\nand broke it. \"These songs, breath by breath,\n\nhave kept me minding the musical modes of Iraq\n\nand the rhythms of Persia. The minor zirafgand,\n\nthe liquid freshness of the twenty-four melodies,\n\nthese have distracted me while caravan after caravan\n\nwas leaving! My poems have kept me in my self,\n\nwhich was the greatest gift to me, that now\n\nI surrender back.\"\n\nWhen someone is counting out\n\ngold for you, don't look at your hands,\n\nor the gold. Look at the giver.\n\n\"But even this wailing recrimination,\" said Omar,\n\n\"is just another shape for enclosure, another joint\n\non the reed. Pierce the segments and be hollow,\n\nwith perforated walls, so flute music can happen.\n\nDon't be a searcher wrapped in the importance of his quest.\n\nRepent of your repenting!\" The old man's heart\n\nwoke, no longer in love with treble\n\nand bass, without weeping\n\nor laughter. In the true bewilderment of the soul\n\nhe went out beyond any seeking, beyond words\n\nand telling, drowned in the beauty,\n\ndrowned beyond deliverance.\n\nWaves cover the old man.\n\nNothing more can be said of him.\n\nHe has shaken out his robe,\n\nand there's nothing in it anymore.\n\nThere is a chase where a falcon dives into the forest\n\nand doesn't come back up. Every moment,\n\nthe sunlight is totally empty\n\nand totally full."

On the right they put the chancellor,\n\nand various secretaries, because the practice\n\nof bookkeeping and writing usually belongs\n\nto the right hand. In the center,\n\nthe sufis,\n\nbecause in meditation they become mirrors.\n\nThe king can look at their faces\n\nand see his original state.\n\nGive the beautiful ones mirrors,\n\nand let them fall in love with themselves.\n\nThat way they polish their souls\n\nand kindle remembering in others.\n\nA close childhood friend once came to visit Joseph.\n\nThey had shared the secrets that children tell each other\n\nwhen they're lying on their pillows at night\n\nbefore they go to sleep. These two\n\nwere completely truthful\n\nwith each other.\n\nThe friend asked, \"What was it like when you realized\n\nyour brothers were jealous and what they planned to do?\"\n\n\"I felt like a lion with a chain around its neck.\n\nNot degraded by the chain, and not complaining,\n\nbut just waiting for my power to be recognized.\"\n\n\"How about down in the well, and in prison?\n\nHow was it then?\"\n\n\"Like the moon when it's getting\n\nsmaller, yet knowing the fullness to come.\n\nLike a seed pearl ground in the mortar for medicine,\n\nthat knows it will now be the light in a human eye.\n\nLike a wheat grain that breaks open in the ground,\n\nthen grows, then gets harvested, then crushed in the mill\n\nfor flour, then baked, then crushed again between teeth\n\nto become a person's deepest understanding.\n\nLost in love, like the songs the planters sing\n\nthe night after they sow the seed.\"\n\nThere is no end\n\nto any of this.\n\nBack to something else the good man\n\nand Joseph talked about.\n\n\"Ah my friend, what have you\n\nbrought me? You know a traveler should not arrive\n\nempty-handed at the door of a friend like me.\n\nThat's going to the grinding stone without your wheat.\n\nGod will ask at the resurrection, 'Did you bring Me\n\na present? Did you forget? Did you think\n\nyou wouldn't see me?\"'\n\nJoseph kept teasing,\n\n\"Let's have it. I want my gift!\"\n\nThe guest began, \"You can't imagine how I've looked\n\nfor something for you. Nothing seemed appropriate.\n\nYou don't take gold down into a goldmine,\n\nor a drop of water to the Sea of Oman!\n\nEverything I thought of was like bringing cumin seed\n\nto Kirmanshah where cumin comes from.\n\nYou have all seeds in your barn. You even have my love\n\nand my soul, so I can't even bring those.\n\nI've brought you a mirror. Look at yourself,\n\nand remember me.\"\n\nHe took the mirror out from his robe\n\nwhere he was hiding it.\n\nWhat is the mirror of being?\n\nNon-being. Always bring a mirror of non-existence\n\nas a gift. Any other present is foolish.\n\nLet the poor man look deep into generosity.\n\nLet bread see a hungry man.\n\nLet kindling behold a spark from the flint.\n\nAn empty mirror and your worst destructive habits,\n\nwhen they are held up to each other,\n\nthat's when the real making begins.\n\nThat's what art and crafting are.\n\nA tailor needs a torn garment to practice his expertise.\n\nThe trunks of trees must be cut and cut again\n\nso they can be used for fine carpentry.\n\nYour doctor must have a broken leg to doctor.\n\nYour defects are the ways that glory gets manifested.\n\nWhoever sees clearly what's diseased in himself\n\nbegins to gallop on the way.\n\nThere is nothing worse\n\nthan thinking you are well enough.\n\nMore than anything, self-corplacency\n\nblocks the workmanship.\n\nPut your vileness up to a mirror and weep.\n\nGet that self-satisfaction flowing out of you!\n\nSatan thought, \"I am better than Adam,\"\n\nand that better than is still strongly in us.\n\nYour stream water may look clean,\n\nbut there's unstirred matter on the bottom.\n\nYour sheikh can dig a side channel\n\nthat will drain that waste off.\n\nTrust your wound to a teacher's surgery.\n\nFlies collect on a wound. They cover it,\n\nthose flies of your self-protecting feelings,\n\nyour love for what you think is yours.\n\nLet a teacher wave away the flies\n\nand put a plaster on the wound.\n\nDon't turn your head. Keep looking\n\nat the bandaged place. That's where\n\nthe light enters you.\n\nAnd don't believe for a moment\n\nthat you're healing yourself."

Tell the truth now. Say it out.\"\n\n\"Eighteen, well seventeen. Sixteen.\n\nActually, uh, fifteen.\"\n\n\"Keep going!

A song-thread flows\n\ncontinuously out of the bird.\n\nTry to see this bird on its clay tower,\n\nand also the hair floating in its beak.\n\nHilal becomes ill. Nine days he lies sick\n\nin the stable. No one notices,\n\nexcept the prophet Muhammad, peace\n\nand blessing be upon him.\n\nHe comes to visit.\n\nHilal's employer is ecstatic.\n\nWith elaborate ceremony he emerges\n\nfrom his upstairs room and kisses the ground\n\nin front of the Prophet. \"In God's name,\n\nplease honor this house.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to visit you.\"\n\n\"Who then?\"\n\n\"There is a new-moon new-man planted near here,\n\nspending the lightness of his humility\n\nlike blossoms on the ground.\n\nWhere is Hilal?\"\n\n\"I haven't seen him for days.\n\nHe must be out with the mules and the horses.\"\n\nMuhammad runs to the stable. It's dark,\n\nand the stench of manure is strong,\n\nbut all that vanishes when friendship enters.\n\nMiracles don't cause faith, but rather\n\nthe scent of kindredness that unites people.\n\nMiracles overwhelm unbelief.\n\nFaith grows from friendship.\n\nWith the familiar fragrance, Hilal wakes up.\n\nHow could such a thing be in a stable?\n\nThrough the legs of the horses he sees\n\nthe robes of Muhammad! He comes crawling out\n\nfrom the dark corner and lays his cheek\n\non Muhammad's feet. Muhammad puts his cheek\n\non Hilal's and kisses his head and face.\n\n\"How hidden can one be!\n\nAre you better? How are you?\"\n\nHow!\n\nA man sits and eats damp clay for moisture.\n\nHow is it with him when a flood of fresh\n\nprophetic rainwater suddenly rides him along?\n\nHow is it when a blind, filthy dog wakes up,\n\nand finds that he's a lion, and not\n\na lion such as could be killed,\n\nbut a spirit-lion who shatters sword\n\nand javelin with just his presence?\n\nHow would that feel? A man crawls for years\n\non his stomach with his eyes closed.\n\nThen one moment he opens his eyes,\n\nand he's in a garden. It's Spring.\n\nHow is it to be free of HOW,\n\nloose in howlessness?\n\nHowlers sit waiting around your table.\n\nThrow them a bone!\n\nThis suggestion: wash before going to the watertank.\n\nThe waters there have grace enough to clean\n\nand give you peace, but wash yourself\n\nof bows before you go.\n\nWash off all wonderings-why\n\nand workings-out-however.\n\nDon't take those with you\n\nto the big watertank.\n\nHusam! Bats don't bother Husamuddin.\n\nHe's an expert on sunlight!\n\nHe's written about the new moon, Hilal.\n\nNow he'll write about the full moon, the sheikh.\n\nNew moon and full moon are the same.\n\nA new moon teaches gradualness\n\nand deliberation and how one gives birth\n\nto oneself slowly.

A covered tray.\n\nThe sheikh uncovers the face of the tray, and on it\n\nthere are four hundred gold dmnars, and in one corner,\n\nanother half a dinar wrapped in a piece of paper.\n\nImmediately the cries of abasement, \"O king of sheikhs,\n\nlord of the lords of mystery!

Don't waste time greeting\n\npeople!' I asked him to give me some advice. 'Stay in the presence of\n\nthose who remind you of your lord, who not only speak wisdom, but\n\nare that.' Then he went back into meditation.\" Ibn Khafif was being\n\ntaught the importance of having his own experience of the unseen,\n\nand not to fret so much about the forms of greeting people, hearing\n\nwisdom, and about what we should be doing.\n\nThere is a South Indian story about soap. Soap is the dirt we buy.\n\nWe introduce it to the dirt we have, and the two dirts are so glad\n\nto see each other they come out and mix! They swim together in the\n\nwarm pleasurable water and, at just the right moment, the washer\n\nlifts the cloth of our true being free of both soap and dirt. Mystical\n\npoetry and other practices may function this way, as soap that dances\n\nwith what disturbs our clarity. Then at some moment they drop away\n\nand leave us clean, ready to be worn again.",

He knew Nasuh's secret,\n\nbut with God's gentleness he didn't speak it.\n\nA gnostic says little, but inside he is full of mysteries,\n\nand crowded with voices. Whoever is served\n\nthat cup keeps quiet.\n\nThe holy man laughed softly and prayed aloud,\n\n\"May God cause you to change your life\n\nin the way you know you should.\"\n\nThe prayer of such a sheikh is different\n\nfrom other prayers. He has so completely dissolved\n\nhis ego, nothinged himself, that what he says\n\nis like God talking to God. How could\n\nsuch a prayer not be granted?\n\nThe means were found to change Nasuh.\n\nWhile he was pouring water into a basin\n\nfor a naked woman, she felt and discovered\n\nthat a pearl was missing from her earring.\n\nQuickly, they locked the doors.\n\nThey searched the cushions, the towels, the rugs,\n\nand the discarded clothes. Nothing.\n\nNow they search\n\nears and mouths and every cleft and orifice.\n\nEveryone is made to strip,\n\nand the queen's lady chamberlain\n\nprobes one by one\n\nthe naked women.\n\nNasuh, meanwhile,\n\nhas gone to his private closet, trembling.\n\n\"I didn't steal the pearl,\n\nbut if they undress and search me,\n\nthey'll see how excited I get\n\nwith these nude ladies.\n\nGod, please,\n\nhelp me!\n\nI have been cold and lecherous,\n\nbut cover my sin this time, PLEASE!\n\nLet me not be exposed for how I've been.\n\nI'll repent!\"\n\nHe weeps and moans and weeps,\n\nfor the moment is upon him.\n\n\"Nasuh!\n\nWe have searched everyone but you. Come out!\"\n\nAt that moment his spirit grows wings, and lifts.\n\nHis ego falls like a battered wall.\n\nHe unites with God, alive,\n\nbut emptied of\n\nNasuh.\n\nHis ship sinks and in its place move the ocean waves.\n\nHis body's disgrace, like a falcon's loosened binding,\n\nslips from the falcon's foot.\n\nHis stones drink in water.\n\nHis field shines like satin with gold threads in it.\n\nSomeone dead a hundred years steps out well\n\nand strong and handsome.\n\nA broken stick\n\nbreaks into bud.\n\nThis all happens inside Nasuh,\n\nafter the call that gave him such fear.\n\nA long pause.\n\nA long, waiting silence.\n\nThen a shout from one of the women, \"Here it is!\"\n\nThe bathhouse fills with clapping.\n\nNasuh sees his new life sparkling out before him.\n\nThe women come to apologize, \"We're so sorry\n\nwe didn't trust you. We just knew\n\nthat you'd taken that pearl.\"\n\nThey kept talking about how they'd suspected him,\n\nand begging his forgiveness.\n\nFinally he replies,\n\n\"I am much more guilty\n\nthan anyone has thought or said. I am the worst person\n\nin the world. What you have said is only a hundredth\n\nof what I've actually done. Don't ask my pardon!\n\nYou don't know me. No one knows me.\n\nGod has hidden my sneakiness. Satan taught me tricks,\n\nbut after a time, those became easy, and I taught Satan\n\nsome new variations. God saw what I did, but chose\n\nnot to publicly reveal my sin.\n\nAnd now, I am sewn back into wholeness!\n\nWhatever I've done,\n\nnow was not done.\n\nWhatever obedience I didn't do,\n\nnow I did!\n\nPure, noble, free, like a cypress,\n\nlike a lily,\n\nis how I suddenly am. I said,\n\nOh no!\n\nHelp me!\n\nAnd that Oh no! became a rope\n\nlet down in my well. I've climbed out to stand here\n\nin the sun. One moment I was at the bottom\n\nof a dank, fearful narrowness, and the next,\n\nI am not contained by this universe.\n\nIf every tip of every hair on me could speak,\n\nI still couldn't say my gratitude.\n\nIn the middle of these streets and gardens, I stand and say\n\nand say again, and it's all I say,\n\nI wish everyone\n\ncould know what I know.\""

I want to wash your clothes\n\nand pick the lice off. I want to bring you milk\n\nto kiss your little hands and feet when it's time\n\nfor you to go to bed. I want to sweep your room\n\nand keep it neat. God, my sheep and goats\n\nare yours.

And what's this with your little hands\n\nand feet? Such blasphemous familiarity sounds like\n\nyou're chatting with your uncles.\n\nOnly something that grows\n\nneeds milk. Only someone with feet needs shoes. Not God!\n\nEven if you meant God's human representatives,\n\nas when God said, 'I was sick, and you did not visit me,'\n\neven then this tone would be foolish and irreverent.\n\nUse appropriate terms. Fatima is a fine name\n\nfor a woman, but if you call a man Fatima,\n\nit's an insult. Body-and-birth language\n\nare right for us on this side of the river,\n\nbut not for addressing the origin,\n\nnot for Allah.\"\n\nThe shepherd repented and tore his clothes and sighed\n\nand wandered out into the desert.\n\nA sudden revelation\n\ncame then to Moses. God's voice:\n\nYou have separated me\n\nfrom one of my own. Did you come as a Prophet to unite,\n\nor to sever?\n\nI have given each being a separate and unique way\n\nof seeing and knowing and saying that knowledge.\n\nWhat seems wrong to you is right for him.\n\nWhat is poison to one is honey to someone else.\n\nPurity and impurity, sloth and diligence in worship,\n\nthese mean nothing to me.\n\nI am apartf rom all that.\n\nWays of worshiping are not to be ranked as better\n\nor worse than one another.\n\nHindus do Hindu things.\n\nThe DravidianM uslims in India do what they do.\n\nIt's all praise, and it's all right.\n\nIt's not me that's glorified in acts of worship.\n\nIt's the worshipers! I don't hear the words\n\nthey say. I look inside at the humility.\n\nThat broken-open lowliness is the reality,\n\nnot the language! Forget phraseology.\n\nI want burning, burning.\n\nBe friends\n\nwith your burning. Burn up your thinking\n\nand your forms of expression!\n\nMoses,\n\nthose who pay attention to ways of behaving\n\nand speaking are one sort.\n\nLovers who burn\n\nare another.\n\nDon't impose a property tax\n\non a burned-out village. Don't scold the Lover.\n\nThe \"wrong\" way he talks is better than a hundred\n\nz66\n\n\"right\" ways of others.\n\nInside the Kaaba\n\nit doesn't matter which direction you point\n\nyour prayer rug!\n\nThe ocean diver doesn't need snowshoes!\n\nThe love-religion has no code or doctrine.\n\nOnly God.\n\nSo the ruby has nothing engraved on it!\n\nIt doesn't need markings.\n\nGod began speaking\n\ndeeper mysteries to Moses. Vision and words,\n\nwhich cannot be recorded here, poured into\n\nand through him. He left himself and came back.\n\nHe went to eternity and came back here.\n\nMany times this happened.\n\nIt's foolish of me\n\nto try and say this. If I did say it,\n\nit would uproot our human intelligences.\n\nIt would shatter all writing pens.\n\nMoses ran after the shepherd.\n\nHe followed the bewildered footprints,\n\nin one place moving straight like a castle\n\nacross a chessboard. In another, sideways,\n\nlike a bishop.\n\nNow surging like a wave cresting,\n\nnow sliding down like a fish,\n\nwith always his feet\n\nmaking geomancy symbols in the sand,\n\nrecording\n\nhis wandering state.\n\nMoses finally caught up\n\nwith him.\n\n\"I was wrong. God has revealed to me\n\nthat there are no rules for worship.\n\nSay whatever\n\nand however your loving tells you to. Your sweet blasphemy\n\nis the truest devotion. Through you a whole world\n\nis freed.\n\nLoosen your tongue and don't worry what comes out.\n\nIt's all the light of the spirit.\"\n\nThe shepherd replied,\n\n\"Moses, Moses,\n\nI've gone beyond even that.\n\nYou applied the whip and my horse shied and jumped\n\nout of itself. The divine nature and my human nature\n\ncame together.\n\nBless your scolding hand and your arm.\n\nI can't say what has happened.\n\nWhat I'm saying now\n\nis not my real condition. It can't be said.\"\n\nThe shepherd grew quiet.\n\nWhen you look in a mirror,\n\nyou see yourself, not the state of the mirror.\n\nThe flute player puts breath into a flute,\n\nand who makes the music? Not the flute.\n\nThe flute player!\n\nWhenever you speak praise\n\nor thanksgiving to God, it's always like\n\nthis dear shepherd's simplicity.\n\nWhen you eventually see\n\nthrough the veils to how things really are,\n\nyou will keep saying again\n\nand again,\n\n\"This is certainly riot like\n\nwe thought it was!\""

Rumi uses anything human beings\n\ndo, no matter how scandalous or cruel or silly, as a lens to examine\n\nsoul growth. A gourd crafted to serve as a flange, allowing a donkey's\n\npenis to enter a woman's vagina just to the point of her pleasure but\n\nnot far enough to harm her, becomes a metaphor for a device a sheikh\n\nmight use to put limits on a disciple.

One day\n\nshe peeked through a crack in the door\n\nand saw the animal's marvelous member\n\nand the delight of the girl\n\nstretched under the donkey.\n\nShe said nothing. Later, she knocked on the door\n\nand called the maid out on an errand,\n\na long and complicated errand.\n\nI won't go into details.\n\nThe servant knew what was happening, though.\n\n\"Ah, my mistress,\" she thought to herself,\n\n\"you should not send away the expert.\n\nWhen you begin to work without full knowledge,\n\nyou risk your life. Your shame keeps you\n\nfrom asking me about the gourd, but you must\n\nhave that to join with this donkey.\n\nThere's a trick you don't know!\"\n\nBut the woman was too fascinated with her idea\n\nto consider any danger. She led the donkey in\n\nand closed the door, thinking, \"With no one around\n\nI can shout in my pleasure.\"\n\nShe was dizzy\n\nwith anticipation, her vagina glowing\n\nand singing like a nightingale.\n\nShe arranged the chair under the donkey,\n\nas she had seen the girl do. She raised her legs\n\nand pulled him into her.\n\nHer fire kindled more,\n\nand the donkey politely pushed as she urged him to,\n\npushed through and into her intestines,\n\nand, without a word, she died.\n\nThe chair fell one way,\n\nand she the other.\n\nThe room was smeared with blood.\n\nReader,\n\nhave you ever seen anyone martyred\n\nfor a donkey? Remember what the Qur'an\n\nsays about the torment of disgracing yourself.\n\nDon't sacrifice your life to your animal-soul!\n\nIf you die of what that leads you to do,\n\nyou are just like this woman on the floor.\n\nShe is an image of immoderation.\n\nRemember her,\n\nand keep your balance.\n\nThe maidservant returns and says, \"Yes, you saw\n\nmy pleasure, but you didn't see the gourd\n\nthat put a limit on it. You opened\n\nyour shop before a master\n\ntaught you the craft.\""

Their eyes were closed like\n\nperfectly matching calligraphy lines.\n\nThe king went looking for the scholar,\n\nand when he saw them there coupled, commented,\n\n\"Well, as it is said, 'A good king\n\nmust serve his subjects from his own table!\"'\n\nThere is joy, a winelike freedom\n\nthat dissolves the mind and restores\n\nthe spirit, and there is manly fortitude\n\nlike the king's, a reasonableness\n\nthat accepts the bewildered lostness.\n\nBut meditate now on steadfastness\n\nand clarity, and let those be the wings\n\nthat lift and soar through the celestial spheres."

King Solomon (luminous divine wisdom) sends mes-\n\nsengers to coax the Queen of Sheba (the bodily soul) to leave her\n\nkingdom and come live with him. She coyly sends envoys back with\n\nfoolishly inappropriateg ifts, and when she herself finally arrives, she\n\ndoes so with the one thing she cannot bear to leave, her filigreed\n\nthrone (the body). The marriageo f spiritual vision with the body\n\nfinds many metaphors throughout Rumi's art:J esus riding the lean\n\ndonkey, the way a river dissolves into the ocean, dawn sunlight filling\n\na ruby, the nightsky contained in a person's eyes. The ecstatic aston-\n\nishment within Rumi's poetry comes from his firsthand wonder at\n\nhow the ocean comes to court the drop!\n\nI once had a dream where I was supposed to give a lecture on\n\nRumi and D. H. Lawrence, but I couldn't find the lecture hall. The\n\nchallenge was to connect Lawrence's dark body-knowledge with\n\nRumi's spirituale nlightenment. I ended up in some anteroom eating\n\nhors d'oeuvres. The mind knows when it's been assigned work out-\n\nside its purview. Rumi's poetry nourishes the part of us that wants a\n\ncontinually unfolding truth, not some confined conclusion. The rela-\n\ntionship of soul wisdom and the body, Solomon and Sheba, is a dy-\n\nnamic dance that keeps generating stories.",

You could have owned\n\nthe largest pearl in existence, but evidently\n\nit was not meant to be.\"\n\nThe man started wailing like a woman in childbirth.\n\nThe bird: \"Didn't I just say, Don't grieve\n\nfor what's in the past?

How could I have\n\na pearl that heavy inside me?\"\n\nThe man came to his senses. \"All right.\n\nTell me Number Three.\"\n\n\"Yes.

Are you God?\n\nI bless the moment you first noticed me. I was dead\n\nand didn't know it.

No one\n\nwould go out, or do any work. No one would pray or fast,\n\nand all power to change would fade\n\nfrom human beings,'\n\nso I kept quiet\n\nwhile I was beating you, that like David\n\nI might shape iron, so that, impossibly,\n\nI might put feathers back into a bird's wing.\n\nGod's silence is necessary, because of humankind's\n\nfaintheartedness. If I had told you about the snake,\n\nyou wouldn't have been able to eat, and if\n\nyou hadn't eaten, you wouldn't have vomited.\n\nI saw your condition and drove my donkey hard\n\ninto the middle of it, saying always under my breath,\n\n'Lord, make it easy on him.' I wasn't permitted\n\nto tell you, and I wasn't permitted to stop\n\nbeating you!\"\n\nThe healed man, still kneeling,\n\n\"I have no way to thank you for the quickness\n\nof your wisdom and the strength\n\nof your guidance.\n\nGod will thank you.\""

Over a stony mountainside,\n\nand it tears its mantle down to the navel.\n\nOver non-existence, it comes into existence.\n\nBut when I speak lovingly for hours, for days,\n\nwith those who take human warmth\n\nand mock it, when I say the Name to them, nothing\n\nhappens. They remain rock, or turn to sand,\n\nwhere no plants can grow. Other diseases are ways\n\nfor mercy to enter, but this non-responding\n\nbreeds violence and coldness toward God.\n\nI am fleeing from that.\n\nAs little by little air steals water, so praise\n\ndries up and evaporates with foolish people\n\nwho refuse to change.

Rumi and Husam would walk together around\n\nKonya or through the vineyards of Meram nearby, letting the subjects\n\nflow into poetry. Passagesf rom the Qur'an, folk tales, jokes, all\n\nintrusions were allowed swimming room in this ocean of sublime jazz\n\nthat perhaps has no parallel in world literature. The Mathnawi is a\n\nhouse of mirrors. Relationship is everywhere, and everywhere we are\n\nshown ourselves. The other reveals us. Rumi's stories are full of reflec-\n\ntions, comic janitors and stealthy maids, judges and impudent lovers\n\nwho disclose our hidings and hypocrisies. The whole always throws\n\nthe parts into relationship, polishing the mirrors. What we see hap-\n\npening in the external drama we can be sure is part of ourselves.

        "poem": "IN CAIRO, DREAMING OF BAGHDAD\n\nNo more muffled drums!\n\nUncover the drumheads!\n\nPlant your flag in an open field!\n\nNo more timid peeking around.\n\nEither you see the beloved,\n\nor you lose your head!\n\nIf your throat's not ready for that wine, cut it!\n\nIf your eyes don't want the fullness of union,\n\nlet them turn white with disease.\n\nEither this deep desire of mine\n\nwill be found on this journey,\n\nor when I get back home!\n\nIt may be that the satisfaction I need\n\ndepends on my going away, so that when I've gone\n\nand come back, I'll find it at home.\n\nI will search for the Friend with all my passion\n\nand all my energy, until I learn\n\nthat I don't need to search.\n\nThe real truth of existence is sealed,\n\nuntil after many twists and turns of the road.\n\nAs in the algebraical method of \"the two errors,\"\n\nthe correct answer comes only after two substitutions,\n\nafter two mistakes. Then the seeker says,\n\n\"If I had known the real way it was,\n\nI would have stopped all the looking around.\"\n\nBut that knowing depends\n\non the time spent looking!\n\nJust as the sheikh's debt could not be paid\n\nuntil the boy's weeping, the story we told in Book II.\n\nYou fear losing a certain eminent position.\n\nYou hope to gain something from that, but it comes\n\nfrom elsewhere. Existence does this switching trick,\n\ngiving you hope from one source, then\n\nsatisfaction from another.\n\nIt keeps you bewildered\n\nand wondering, and lets your trust in the unseen grow.\n\nYou think to make your living from tailoring,\n\nbut then somehow money comes in\n\nthrough goldsmithing,\n\nwhich had never entered your mind.\n\nI don't know whether the union I want will come\n\nthrough my effort, or my giving up effort,\n\nor from something completely separate\n\nfrom anything I do or don't do.\n\nI wait and fidget and flop about\n\nas a decapitated chicken does, knowing that\n\nthe vital spirit has to escape this body\n\neventually, somehow!\n\nThis desire will find an opening.\n\nThere was once a man\n\nwho inherited a lot of money and land.\n\nBut he squandered it all too quickly. Those who inherit\n\nwealth don't know what work it took to get it.\n\nIn the same way, we don't know the value of our souls,\n\nwhich were given to us for nothing!\n\nSo the man was left alone without provisions,\n\nan owl in the desert.\n\nThe Prophet has said\n\nthat a true seeker must be completely empty like a lute\n\nto make the sweet music of Lord, Lord.\n\nWhen the emptiness starts to get filled with something,\n\nthe one who plays the lute puts it down\n\nand picks up another.\n\nThere is nothing more subtle and delightful\n\nthan to make that music.\n\nStay empty and held\n\nbetween those fingers, where where\n\ngets drunk with nowhere.\n\nThis man was empty,\n\nand the tears came. His habitual stubbornness\n\ndissolved. This is the way with many seekers.\n\nThey moan in prayer, and the perfumed smoke of that\n\nfloats into heaven, and the angels say, \"Answer\n\nthis prayer. This worshiper has only you\n\nand nothing else to depend on. Why do you go first\n\nto the prayers of those less devoted?\"\n\nGod says,\n\n\"By deferring my generosity I am helping him.\n\nHis need dragged him by the hair into my presence.\n\nIf I satisfy that, he'll go back to being absorbed\n\nin some idle amusement. Listen how passionate he is!\n\nThat torn-open cry is the way he should live.\"\n\nNightingales are put in cages\n\nbecause their songs give pleasure.\n\nWhoever heard of keeping a crow?\n\nWhen two people, one decrepit and the other young\n\nand handsome, come into a bakery where the baker\n\nis an admirer of young men, and both of them\n\nask for bread, the baker will immediately\n\ngive what he has on hand to the old man.\n\nBut to the other he will say, \"Sit down and wait awhile.\n\nThere's fresh bread baking in the house. Almost ready!\"\n\nAnd when the hot bread is brought, the baker will say,\n\n\"Don't leave. The halvah is coming!\"\n\nSo he finds ways of detaining the young man with,\n\n\"Ah, there's something important I want to tell you about.\n\nStay. I'll be back in a moment. Something very important!\"\n\nThis is how it is when true devotees\n\nsuffer disappointment\n\nin the good they want to do,\n\nor the bad they want to avoid.\n\nSo this man with nothing, who had inherited everything\n\nand squandered it, kept weeping, Lord, Lord!\n\nFinally in a dream he heard a voice, \"Your wealth\n\nis in Cairo. Go there to such and such a spot\n\nand dig, and you'll find what you need.\"\n\nSo he left on the long journey,\n\nand when he saw the towers of Cairo,\n\nhe felt his back grow warm with new courage.\n\nBut Cairo is a large city,\n\nand before he could find the spot,\n\nhe had to wander about.\n\nHe had no money, of course, so he begged\n\namong the townspeople, but he felt ashamed doing that.\n\nHe decided, \"I will go out at night\n\nand call like the night-mendicants that people\n\nthrow coins into the street for.\"\n\nShame and dignity and hunger\n\nwere pushing him forward and backward and sideways!\n\nSuddenly, he was seized by the night patrol.\n\nIt so happened that many had been robbed recently\n\nin Cairo at night, and the caliph had told the police\n\nto assume that anyone out roaming after dark\n\nwas a thief.\n\nIt's best not to let offenders go unpunished.\n\nThen they poison the whole body of society. Cut off\n\nthe snakebitten finger! Don't be sympathetic\n\nwith thieves. Consider instead\n\nthe public suffering. In those days\n\nrobbers were expert, and numerous!\n\nSo the night patrol grabbed the man.\n\n\"Wait!\n\nI can explain!\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"I am not a criminal.\n\nI am new to Cairo. I live in Baghdad.\" He told the story\n\nof his dream and the buried treasure,\n\nand he was so believable in the telling that\n\nthe night patrolman began to cry. Always,\n\nthe fragrance of truth has that effect.\n\nPassion\n\ncan restore healing power, and prune the weary boughs\n\nto new life. The energy of passion is everything!\n\nThere are fake satisfactions that simulate passion.\n\nThey taste cold and delicious,\n\nbut they just distract you and prevent you\n\nfrom the search. They say,\n\n\"I will relieve your passion.\n\nTake me. Take me!\"\n\nRun from false remedies\n\nthat dilute your energy. Keep it rich and musky.\n\nThe night patrol said, \"I know you're not a thief.\n\nYou're a good man, but you're kind of a fool.\n\nI've had that dream before.\n\nI was told, in my dream,\n\nthat there was a treasure for me in Baghdad,\n\nburied in a certain quarter of the city\n\non such and such a street.\"\n\nThe name of the street\n\nthat he said was where this man lived!\n\n\"And the dream-\n\nvoice told me, 'It's in So-and-so's house.\n\nGo there and get it!\"'\n\nWithout knowing,\n\nhe had described the exact house,\n\nand mentioned this man's name!\n\n\"But I didn't do\n\nwhat the dream said to do, and look at you,\n\nwho did, wandering the world, fatigued,\n\nand begging in the streets!\"\n\nSo it came quietly\n\nto the seeker, though he didn't say it out loud,\n\n\"What I'm longing for lived in my house in Baghdad!\"\n\nHe filled with joy. He breathed continuous praise.\n\nFinally he said,\n\n\"The water of life is here.\n\nI'm drinking it. But I had to come\n\nthis long way to know it!\""

The injuries and troubles he suffered\n\ndeserve mention, but I'll make it short. The young man\n\narrives at the sheikh's house and knocks.\n\nThe sheikh's wife sticks her head out, \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I come with the intention of seeing the sheikh.\"\n\n\"Oho,\" laughs the wife, \"lock at His Reverence! Was there\n\nnothing to do where you live that you came on such an idle\n\nsight-seeing expedition? Do you hate your hometown?

They forget any real religious ceremony\n\nand ritual prayers.\"\n\nThe young man could stand it no more.\n\n\"What is this? I've been ambushed by a night patrol\n\nin full daylight! Your blitherings try to keep me\n\nfrom the presence of a holy man,\n\nbut I know what light led me here, the same\n\nthat turned the golden calf into words in a sacred story.\n\nA saint is a theater where the qualities of God can be seen.\n\nDon't try to keep me out. Puff on this candle,\n\nand your face will get burned! Rather try blowing out\n\nthe sun, or fitting a muzzle on the sea!\n\nOld bats like you dream that their cave-dark\n\nis everywhere, but it's not.\n\nMy determination to be in that presence is quick and constant.\n\nYou won't stop or slow me.\n\nA revealer of mystery and that which is revealed\n\nare the same. Seed, sowing, growing, harvest, one presence.\n\nThe husk, old hag of a nagging world,\n\nshould bow to that.\n\nHallai said, I am God, and lived it out.\n\nWhat happens when the I disappears?\n\nWhat's left after not?\n\nWhoever scoffs at these questions and the experiences\n\nthey point to, his arrogant spit comes back in his face.\n\nThere is no spitting on the way we're on.\n\nRain itself turns to spit on those who mock\n\nand casually show disrespect to saints.\"\n\nWith that he left the doorway and walked about\n\nasking in the town. Finally someone said, \"The qutb\n\nis in the forest collecting wood.\" The young dervish\n\nran toward the forest but with a doubt,\n\n\"Why should such a sheikh have such a woman\n\nfor a wife, such an opposite, such a neanderthal!\n\nGod forgive my impugning. Who am I\n\nto judge?\" But the question remained.\n\nHow could a teacher lie with that woman!\n\nCan a guide agree with a thief?\n\nSuddenly Sheikh Kharraqani appears, riding a lion,\n\nfirewood stacked behind him. His whip,\n\na live serpent. Every sheikh rides a fierce lion,\n\nwhether you see it or not. Know this\n\nwith your other eyes: There are thousands of lions\n\nunder your teacher's thighs and all of them\n\nstacked with wood!\n\nKharraqani knew the problem and immediately began to answer,\n\n\"Well, it's not out of desire t -at I put up with her!\n\nDon't think that. It's not her perfume\n\nor her bright-colored clothes. Enduring her\n\npublic disdain has made me strong and patient.\n\nShe is my practice. Nothing can be clear\n\nwithout a polar opposite present. Two banners,\n\none black, one white, and between them\n\nsomething gets settled. Between Pharaoh\n\nand Moses, the Red Sea.\n\nYou consider issues, but not deeply enough.\n\nYour spring is frozen. Faith is a flowing.\n\nDon't try to forge cold iron.\n\nStudy David, the ironsmith, and dancer, and musician.\n\nMove into the sun. You're wrapped in fantasy\n\nand inner mumbling. When spirit enters,\n\na man begins to wander freely,\n\nescaped and overrunning through the garden plants,\n\nspontaneous and soaking in.\"\n\nNow a miracle story ..."

        "poem": "Listen to this, and hear the irystery inside:\n\nA snake-catcher went into the mountains to find a snake.\n\nHe wanted a friendly pet, and one that would amaze\n\naudiences, but he was looking for a reptile, something\n\nthat has no knowledge of friendship.\n\nIt was winter.\n\nIn the deep snow he saw a frighteningly huge dead snake.\n\nHe was afraid to touch it, but he did.\n\nIn fact, he dragged the thing into Baghdad,\n\nhoping people would pay to see it.\n\nThis is how foolish\n\nwe've become! A human being is a mountain range!\n\nSnakes are fascinated by us! Yet we sell ourselves\n\nto look at a dead snake.\n\nWe are like beautiful satin\n\nused to patch burlap. \"Come see the dragon I killed,\n\nand hear the adventures!\" That's what he announced,\n\nand a large crowd came,\n\nbut the dragon was not dead,\n\njust dormant! He set up his show at a crossroads.\n\nThe ring of gawking people got thicker, everybody\n\non tiptoe, men and women, noble and peasant, all\n\npacked together unconscious of their differences.\n\nIt was like the Resurrection!\n\nHe began to unwind the thick ropes and remove\n\nthe cloth coverings he'd wrapped it so well in.\n\nSome little movement.\n\nThe hot Iraqi sun had woken\n\nthe terrible life. The people nearest started screaming.\n\nPanic! The dragon tore easily and hungrily\n\nloose, killing many instantly.\n\nThe snake-catcher stood there,\n\nfrozen. \"What have I brought out of the mountains?\" The snake\n\nbraced against a post and crushed the man and consumed him.\n\nThe snake is your animal-soul. When you bring it\n\ninto the hot air of your wanting-energy, warmed\n\nby that and by the prospect of power and wealth,\n\nit does massive damage.\n\nLeave it in the snow mountains.\n\nDon't expect to oppose it with quietness\n\nand sweetness and wishing.\n\nThe nafs don't respond to those,\n\nand they can't be killed. It takes a Moses to deal\n\nwith such a beast, to lead it back, and make it lie down\n\nin the snow. But there was no Moses then.\n\nHundreds of thousands died."

Yet two extended\n\nstories, near the beginning of Book I and near the end of Book VI,\n\ngive a kind of rounded effect to the whole. They are love stories.\n\nIn both, the narrow romantic love changes to ecstatic love of the\n\nbeloved, and in both there is a disturbing act of violence (the poison-\n\ning of the goldsmith and the killing of the second brother) that is cru-\n\ncial to the Khidresque mystery. The Mathnawi itself is a love story\n\nthat obliterates lovers. \"Don't look for me in a human shape.\" These\n\nare two stories of that difficult truth: How wanting the Chinese\n\nprincess leads into the mystery of Die before you die. How a picture,\n\nan appearance, starts us, the king's three sons, out on a path to the\n\nformless marriage. It's overstating the point to say that the stories\n\n\"frame\" the Mathnawi. Where the refrain \"This never ends\" keeps\n\nrevolving by, no model of linear structure is appropriate.",

        "poem": "Do you know why your soul-mirror\n\ndoes not reflect as clearly as it might?\n\nBecause rust has begun to cover it.\n\nIt needs to be cleaned.\n\nHere's a story\n\nabout the inner state that's meant by soul-mirror.\n\nIn the old days there was a king\n\nwho was powerful in both his kingdoms,\n\nthe visible as well as the spiritual.\n\nOne day as he was riding on the hunt, he saw a girl\n\nand was greatly taken with her beauty.\n\nAs was the custom,\n\nhe paid her family handsomely and asked that she come\n\nto be a servant at the palace. fie was in love with her.\n\nThe feelings trembled and flapped in his chest\n\nlike a bird newly put in a cage.\n\nBut as soon as she arrived, she fell ill.\n\nThe king was like the man who had a donkey,\n\nbut no saddle for the pack. Then he bought a saddle,\n\nand wolves killed the donkey.\n\nHe had a waterjar,\n\nbut no water. Then he found water, but the pitcher\n\nfell and broke.\n\nHe brought his doctors together.\n\n\"You have both our lives in your hands. Her life\n\nis my life. Whoever heals her will receive\n\nthe finest treasure I have, the coral inlaid\n\nwith pearls, anything!\"\n\n\"We'll do what we can. Each of us\n\nis the healing-savior of our regions. Surely\n\nwe can find a cure.\"\n\nThey neglected, in the pride\n\nof their accomplishments, to say If God wills.\n\nI don't mean that just the saying of the phrase\n\nwould have helped.\n\nThere was a coldness and a closed\n\nquality beneath the omission. There are many\n\nwho don't say Inshallah, and yet their whole soul\n\nresonates with it all the time!\n\nSo the doctors began,\n\nand no matter what they tried, the girl got more pale\n\nand thin. The effects of their medicines were\n\nthe opposite of what they expected.\n\nOxymel\n\nproduced bile. Almond oil caused dryness. Myrobalen,\n\ninstead of loosening the bowels, constricted them.\n\nWater seemed to feed the fever.\n\nThe king saw\n\nthat his doctors were helpless. He ran barefooted\n\nto the mosque. He knelt on the prayer rug\n\nand soaked the point of it with his tears.\n\nHe dissolved into an annihilated state,\n\nand as he came out of that, he spoke this prayer:\n\n\"You know what's hidden here. I don't know what to do.\n\nYou have said, 'Even though I know all secrets,\n\nstill declare it outwardly with an action.\"'\n\nHe cried out loud for help, and the ocean of grace\n\nsurged over him. He slept in the midst\n\nof his weeping on the prayer rug.\n\nIn his dream an old man appeared.\n\n\"Good king,\n\nI have news. Tomorrow a stranger will come.\n\nI have sent him. He is a physician you can trust.\n\nListen to him.\"\n\nAs dawn came, the king was sitting up\n\nin the belvedere on his roof. He saw someone coming,\n\na person like the dawn. He ran to meet this guest.\n\nLike two swimmers who love the water, their souls knit\n\ntogether without being sewn, no seam.\n\nThe king said,\n\n\"You are my beloved, not the girl! But actions\n\nspring from actions in this reality.\n\nWhat should I do?\"\n\nWe should always ask for discipline.\n\nOne who has no self-control cannot receive grace.\n\nAnd it's not just himself he hurts. Undisciplined\n\npeople set fire to the landscape!\n\nA table of food\n\nwas once coming down from the sky to feed Moses\n\nand his people, when suddenly voices from the crowd\n\ncalled out, \"Where's the garlic?\"\n\nand \"We want lentils!\"\n\nAt once the bread and the dishes\n\nof grace-food disappeared. Everyone had to keep digging\n\nwith mattocks and cutting with long scythes.\n\nThen Jesus interceded and sent more trays of food.\n\nBut again some insolent people showed no respect.\n\nThey grabbed like it wouldn't be enough,\n\neven though Jesus\n\nkept telling them, \"This food will last.\n\nIt will always be here.\"\n\nTo be suspicious and greedy\n\nwhen majesty arrives is the worst arrogance.\n\nThe gates closed.\n\nWithhold your giving, and no\n\nrainclouds will form. When sex goes on between\n\neverybody all the time, epidemics spread\n\nin every direction.\n\nWhen you feel groomed over,\n\nit's your failure to praise. Irreverence\n\nand no discipline rob your soul of light.\n\nThe king opened\n\nhis arms and held the saintly doctor to him. He kissed\n\nhis hand and his forehead and asked how his journey\n\nhad been. Many dear concerns for this one\n\nwho had been announced in his dream.\n\nHe led him to the head table.\n\n\"At last, I have found what patience can bring.\n\nThis one whose face answers any question, who simply\n\nby looking can loosen the knot of intellectual discussion.\n\nYou translate what is inside us.\n\nIf you were to vanish, this vast meeting room\n\nwould shrink to a closet. Protect us.\"\n\nThey talked and ate a spirit meal. Then the king\n\ntook the doctor's hand and led him to where\n\nthe girl lay, telling him the story\n\nof her illness.\n\nThe doctor felt her pulse\n\nand observed her coloring and her urine. \"Your healers\n\nhave not helped. They've made her worse.\n\nThey don't know the inner states.\"\n\nThe secret\n\nof her pain opened to him, but he didn't tell the king\n\nwhat it was. It was love, of course.\n\nThe ailments of love are different from any other.\n\nLove is the astrolabe that sights into the mysteries\n\nof God.\n\nEarth-love, spirit-love, any love\n\nlooks into that yonder, and whatever I try to say\n\nexplaining love is embarrassing!\n\nSome commentary\n\nclarifies, but with love silence is clearer.\n\nA pen went scribbling along, but when it tried\n\nto write love, it broke.\n\nIf you want to expound on love,\n\ntake your intellect out and let it lie down\n\nin the mud. It's no help.\n\nYou want proof that the sun exists, so you stay up\n\nall night talking about it. Finally you sleep\n\nas the sun comes up.\n\nLook at it! Nothing\n\nis so strange in this entire world as the sun.\n\nThe sun of the soul is even more so. It has no yesterday!\n\nThe physical sun is unique, but it's possible\n\nto imagine something like it.\n\nThe spiritual sun\n\nhas nothing comparable, inner or outer.\n\nImagination cannot contain it. Word of that\n\nsun, Shams, came,\n\nand everything hid. Now Husam\n\ntouches my arm. He wants me to say more about Shams.\n\nNot now, Husam. I don't know how to make words make\n\nsense, or praise. In the Friend-place nothing true\n\ncan be said. Let me just be here.\n\nBut Husam begs,\n\n\"Feed me! Hurry! Time is a sharp downstroke. A sufi\n\nis supposed to be a child of the moment. Aren't you\n\na sufi? Don't say tomorrow or later!\"\n\nAnd I reply,\n\n\"It's better that the way of the Friend be concealed\n\nin a story. Let the mystery come through what\n\npeople say around the lovers, not from\n\nwhat lovers say to each other.\"\n\n\"No! I want this\n\nas naked and true as it can be. I don't wear a shirt\n\nwhen I lie down with my beloved!\"\n\n\"0 Husam. If the Friend\n\ncame to you completely naked, your chest could not stand it.\n\nYou wouldn't be here in your body any longer. Ask\n\nfor what you want, but within some limits.\n\nA little stick can't hold up a mountain.\n\nIf that inner sun by which existence exists\n\ncame even a little closer, everything\n\nwould be scorched. Don't ask for that.\n\nSay no more for now about Shamsi Tabriz.\"\n\nThis has no end.\n\nGo back to the beginning,\n\nthe end of the story\n\nof the king and the lovesick maiden\n\nand the holy doctor, who said,\n\n\"Leave me alone with the girl.\"\n\nIt was done, and quietly he began.\n\n\"Where are you from?\n\nWho are your relatives there? Who else are you close\n\nto in that region?\"\n\nOn and on he gently asked\n\nabout her life. When someone steps barefooted on a thorn,\n\nhe immediately puts his foot on his knee and searches\n\nwith a needle, and when he can't locate the tip,\n\nhe moistens around the place with moisture\n\nfrom his lips. A splinter is often\n\ndifficult to get out.\n\nHow much more difficult a thorn\n\nin the heart! If everyone could find that thorn\n\nin themselves, things would be\n\nmuch more peaceful here!\n\nSomeone puts a clump of burrs\n\nunder a donkey's tail. The donkey doesn't know\n\nwhat's wrong. He just starts jumping\n\nand bucking around.\n\nAn intelligent, thorn-removing\n\ndoctor must come and investigate.\n\nSo the divine physician\n\nasked about her friends and held her hand\n\nto feel the pulse.\n\nShe told many stories of her home,\n\nmentioning many names, and he would say the names again\n\nafter her to test the pulse reaction.\n\nFinally he asked,\n\n\"When you visit other towns, where are you most likely to go?\"\n\nShe said one town, then another, where she bought bread\n\nand where salt, describing the houses,\n\nuntil he happened\n\nto say the word Samarcand!\n\nThe dear city sweet as candy.\n\nShe blushed. Her breath caught. 0 she loves\n\na goldsmith in Samarcand! She misses him so.\n\n\"Where exactly\n\ndoes he live?\"\n\n\"At the head of the bridge on Ghatafar Street.\"\n\n\"Now I can heal you. Don't be afraid. I will do to you\n\nwhat rain does to a meadow. But don't tell this\n\nto anyone, certainly not the king.\n\nWhen the love center\n\nin your chest becomes the grave for such a secret,\n\nthen what you want will be quickly yours.\"\n\nSeeds must hide\n\nin the ground to become whatever is in them.\n\nThe girl felt better. She trusted him.\n\nThe doctor\n\nwent to the king and told him part of the story.\n\n\"On some pretext\n\nwe must bring here from Samarcand a certain goldsmith.\n\nLure him with the prospect of wealth and honors.\"\n\nThe king's messengers went with robes and coins\n\nand easily persuaded the man to leave\n\nhis family and his town.\n\nHe rode an Arabian horse\n\ninto the presence of the king and the doctor,\n\nwho said,\n\n\"Marry the girl to rhis man,\n\nand she will be completely cured.\"\n\nIt was done,\n\nand for six months those two loved and made love\n\nand totally satisfied themselves with each other.\n\nThe girl was restored to perfect health.\n\nThen the physician gave the goldsmith a potion,\n\nso that he began to sicken.\n\nHis handsomeness faded,\n\nand his strength dwindled. Little by little he became\n\nsunken-cheeked and jaundiced and ugly,\n\nand the girl stopped\n\nloving him. Any love based on physical beauty\n\nis not love.\n\n\"This world is a mountain. What we do\n\nis a shout. The echo comes back to us.\"\n\nThe goldsmith said\n\nthat and died. Choose to love the one\n\nwho does not die.\n\nDon't say, \"But how can we do that?\"\n\nThe generous one is not hard to find.\n\nBut what about\n\nthe doctor's poisoning the poor goldsmith! It was not done\n\nfor the king's sake. The reason is a mystery\n\nlike Khidr's cutting the boy's throat.\n\nEverything\n\nthe doctor did was out of God's will. Khidr\n\nsunk the boat, yet it was right to do.\n\nWhen someone\n\nis killed by a doctor like this one, it's a blessing,\n\neven though it might not seem so.\n\nA child cries\n\nat its first haircut, but not the mother. Such a doctor\n\nis part of a larger generosity. He takes away one\n\nand gives back a hundred.\n\nDon't judge his actions\n\nby what you would do. You are not living\n\ncompletely within truth as he is."

        "title": "THE THREE BROTHERS AND THE CHINESE PRINCESS",
        "poem": "There was a king who had three\n\nequally accomplished sons.\n\nEach was generous and wise, and fiercely\n\ndecisive when the need arose.\n\nThey stood like three strongly burning candles\n\nbefore their father, ready to set out on a journey\n\nto distant parts of his kingdom to see\n\nif they were being administered fairly and well.\n\nEach kissed the king's hand as a sign\n\nof farewell and obedience.\n\n\"Go wherever you are drawn to go,\" said the king,\n\n\"and dance on your way.\n\nYou are protected.\n\nI only warn you not to enter one particular\n\ncastle, the one called The Fortress\n\nThat Takes Away Clarity.\n\nThat castle has a gallery of beautiful pictures\n\nwhich causes great difficulty for the royal family.\n\nIt's like the chamber Zuleikha decorated to trap Joseph,\n\nwhere her picture was everywhere.\n\nHe could not avoid\n\nlooking at her. Stay away from that one place.\"\n\nOf course, as it happens, the three princes\n\nwere obsessed with seeing that castle, and in spite\n\nof their father's admonition they went\n\ninto it.\n\nIt had five gates facing the land and five\n\nfacing the ocean, as the five external senses\n\ntake in the color and perfume of phenomena\n\nand the five inner senses open onto the mystery.\n\nThe thousands of pictures there made the princes\n\nrestless. They wandered the hallways drunkenly,\n\nuntil they came,\n\nall three at the same time,\n\nto stand before a particular portrait,\n\na woman's face.\n\nThey fell hopelessly in love. \"This is what our father\n\nwarned us of. We thought we were strong enough\n\nto resist anything, as one who has phthisis\n\nthinks he's well enough to go on,\n\nbut we're not!\n\nWho is this?\"\n\nA wise sheikh revealed to them, \"She\n\nis the Chinese princess, the hidden one.\n\nThe Chinese king has concealed her as the spirit\n\nis wrapped in an embryo. No one may come\n\ninto her presence.\n\nBirds are not even allowed\n\nto fly over her roof. No one can figure a way in.\n\nShe can't be won by contriving. Give up on that!\"\n\nThe princes put their heads together anyway,\n\ncomrades in one sighing passion.\n\nThe oldest said, \"We've always been bold\n\nwhen we gave counsel to others, but look at us!\n\nWe used to say, Patiencei s the key, but the rules\n\nwe made for others are no help now. We advised, Laugh!\n\nWhy are we so quiet? Where is our strength?\"\n\nIn despair\n\nthey set out for China, not with any hope for a union\n\nwith the princess, but just to be closer to her.\n\nThey left everything and went toward the hidden beloved.\n\nThey lived disguised in the capital, trying\n\nto devise some way into the palace.\n\nFinally the eldest, \"I can't wait like this.\n\nI don't want to live if I have to live separated\n\nfrom the beloved. This is the one\n\nI've been beating the drum for my entire life.\n\nWhat does a duck care about a shipwreck?\n\nJust the duck's feet in ocean water is ship enough.\n\nMy soul and my body are married to this boasting.\n\nI am dreaming but I'm not asleep.\n\nI brag but I do not lie.\n\nI'm a candle.\n\nPass the knife through my neck a hundred times,\n\nI'll burn just as brightly.\n\nThe haystack of my existence\n\nhas caught on both sides. Let it burn all night\n\ndown to nothing.\n\nOn the road the moon gives\n\nall the light I need. I'm going to confront the king\n\nwith my desire.\"\n\nHis brothers tried to persuade him\n\nnot to, but they couldn't. He sprang up\n\nand came staggering into the presence of the Chinese\n\nking, who knew what was happening, though\n\nhe kept silent.\n\nThat king was inside the three\n\nbrothers, but he pretended to be unfamiliar\n\nwith them.\n\nThe fire under the kettle is the appearance.\n\nThe boiling water is the reality.\n\nThe beloved\n\nis in your veins though he or she may seem\n\nto have a form outside you.\n\nThe prince knelt\n\nand kissed the king's feet, and stayed there,\n\nbowed down.\n\n\"This young man will have everything\n\nhe seeks, and twenty times that which he left\n\nbehind. He gambled and flung off his robe\n\nin ecstasy. Such love is worth a thousand robes.\n\nThis one is an ambassador from that love,\n\nand he is doing his work well.''\n\nThe prince heard this\n\nand could not speak, but his soul spoke constantly\n\nwith that soul. The prince thought, \"This is\n\nreality, this waking, this melting away.\"\n\nHe stayed bowed down with the king a long time,\n\ncooking. \"Execution is one thing,\n\nbut I am being executed\n\nagain and again every moment! Poor in wealth,\n\nbut rich in lives to sacrifice.\n\nNo one can play\n\nthe game of love with just one head!\"\n\nThis joyful waiting\n\nconsumed the prince. The form of the beloved\n\nleft his mind and he found union.\n\n\"The clothes of the body were sweet silk,\n\nbut this nakedness is sweeter.\"\n\nThis subject can go\n\nno further. What comes next must stay hidden.\n\nOne rides\n\nto the ocean on horseback, but after that\n\nthe wooden horse of mystical silence\n\nmust carry you.\n\nWhen that boat sinks,\n\nyou are the fish, neither silent nor speaking,\n\na marvel with no name.\n\nSo the oldest brother died,\n\nand the middle brother came to the funeral.\n\n\"What's this?\n\nA fish from the same sea!\" mused the king. The chamberlain\n\ncalled out, \"A son of the same father, the brother\n\nnext in age to the deceased.\"\n\nThe king, \"Yes, a keepsake\n\nfrom that one to me.\"\n\nSo the sublime kindnesses\n\ndescended again, and the courtyard seemed split apart\n\nlike a pomegranate laughing, with all the forms\n\nof the universe opening their tent flaps,\n\nnew creations every second.\n\nHe had read about such\n\nrevelations in books. Now it was his. He kept saying,\n\n\"Is there more? Is there more?\" Fed from the king's nature,\n\nhe felt a satisfaction he'd never felt before,\n\nand then there came a pride.\n\n\"Am I not also a king,\n\nthe son of a king? Why is this one controlling me?\n\nI should open my own shop, independent of him.\"\n\nThe king thought, \"I give you pure light,\n\nand you throw dirt in my face!\"\n\nThe middle brother\n\nsuddenly realized what he had inwardly done,\n\nbut it was too late.\n\nHis magnificence\n\nwas stripped away. No longer a garden peacock,\n\nhe flew like a lonely owl in the wilderness,\n\nlike Adam plowing an ox far from Eden.\n\nHe came to himself\n\nand asked forgiveness, and with his repentance\n\nhe combined something else, the deep pain\n\nthat comes from losing the union.\n\nThis story must be\n\nshortened. After a year when the king came out\n\nof his own self-effacement, he found one arrow missing\n\nfrom his quiver and the middle brother dead,\n\nshot through the throat.\n\nThe king wept, both slayer\n\nand chief mourner. Yet all was well. The middle brother too\n\nhad gone to the beloved through the killing eye\n\nthat blasted his conceit.\n\nIt was the third brother,\n\nwho had been ill up until now,\n\nwho received the hand of the princess.\n\nHe lived the marriage of form and spirit,\n\nand did absolutely nothing\n\nto deserve it."

Every moment,\n\na new beauty.\n\nAnd never any boredom!\n\nInstead this abundant, pouring\n\nnoise of many springs in your ears.\n\nThe tree limbs will move like people dancing,\n\nwho suddenly know what the mystical life is.\n\nThe leaves snap their fingers like they're hearing music.\n\nThey are! A sliver of a mirror shines out\n\nfrom under a felt covering. Think how it will be\n\nwhen the whole thing is opera to the air and the sunlight!\n\nThere are some mysteries that I'm not telling you.\n\nThere's so much doubt everywhere, so many opinions\n\nthat say, \"What you announce may be true\n\nin the future, but not now.\"\n\nBut this form of universal truth that I see\n\nsays,\n\nThis is not a prediction. This is here\n\nin this instant, cash in the hand!\n\nThis reminds me of the sons of Uzayr,\n\nwho were out on the road looking for their father.\n\nThey had grown old, and their father had miraculously\n\ngrown young! They met him and asked, \"Pardon us, sir,\n\nbut have you seen Uzayr? We heard that he's supposed\n\nto be coming along this road today.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Uzayr, \"he's right behind me.\"\n\nOne of the sons replied, \"That's good news!\"\n\nThe other fell on the ground.\n\nHe had recognized his father\n\n\"What do you mean news! We're already inside\n\nthe sweetness of his presence.\"\n\nTo your minds there is such a thing as news,\n\nwhereas to the inner knowing, it's all\n\nin the middle of its happening.\n\nTo doubters, this is a pain.\n\nTo believers, it's gospel.\n\nTo the lover and the visionary,\n\nit's life as it's being lived!\n\nThe rules of faithfulness\n\nare just the door and the doorkeeper.\n\nThey keep the presence from being interrupted.\n\nBeing unfaithful is like the outside of a fruit peeling.\n\nIt's dry and bitter because it's facing away from the center.\n\nBeing faithful is like the inside of the peeling,\n\nwet and sweet. But the place for peelings\n\nis the fire. The real inside is beyond \"sweet\"\n\nand \"bitter.\" It's the source of deliciousness.\n\nThis can't be said. I'm drowning in it!\n\nTurn back! And let me cleave a road through water\n\nlike Moses. This much I will say,\n\nand leave the rest hidden:\n\nYour intellect is in fragments, like bits of gold\n\nscattered over many matters. You must scrape them\n\ntogether, so the royal stamp can be pressed into you.\n\nCohere, and you'll be as lovely as Samarcand\n\nwith its central market, or Damascus. Grain by grain,\n\ncollect the parts. You'll be more magnificent\n\nthan a flat coin. You'll be a cup\n\nwith carvings of the king\n\naround the outside.\n\nThe Friend will become bread and springwater for you,\n\na lamp and a helper, your favorite dessert\n\nand a glass of wine.\n\nUnion with that one\n\nis grace. Gather the pieces,\n\nso I can show you what is.\n\nThat's what talking is for,\n\nto help us to be One. Manyness\n\nis having sixty different emotions.\n\nUnity is peace, and silence.\n\nI know I ought to be silent,\n\nbut the excitement of this keeps opening\n\nmy mouth as a sneeze or a yawn does.\n\nMuhammad says, I ask forgiveness seventy times a day,\n\nand I do the same. Forgive me. Forgive my talking\n\nso much. But the way God makes mysteries manifest\n\nquickens and keeps the flow of words in me continual.\n\nA sleeper sleeps while his bedclothes drink in\n\nthe riverwater. The sleeper dreams of running around\n\nlooking for water and pointing in the dream to mirages,\n\n\"Water! There! There!\" It's that There!\n\nthat keeps him asleep. In the future, in the distance,\n\nthose are illusions. Taste the here and the now of God.\n\nThis present thirst is your real intelligence,\n\nnot the back-and-forth, mercurial brightness.\n\nDiscursiveness dies and gets put in the grave.\n\nThis contemplative joy does not.\n\nScholarly knowledge is a vertigo,\n\nan exhausted famousness.\n\nListening is better.\n\nBeing a teacher is a form of desire,\n\na lightning flash. Can you ride to Wahksh,\n\nfar up the Oxus River, on a streak of lightning?\n\nLightning is not guidance.\n\nLightning simply tells the clouds to weep.\n\nCry a little. The streak-lightning of our minds\n\ncomes so that we'll weep and long for our real lives.\n\nA child's intellect says, \"I should go to school.\"\n\nBut that intellect cannot teach itself.\n\nA sick person's mind says, \"Go to the doctor,\"\n\nbut that doesn't cure the patient.\n\nSome devils were sneaking up close to heaven\n\ntrying to hear the secrets, when a voice came,\n\n\"Get out of here. Go to the world. Listen\n\nto the prophets!\" Enter the house through the door.\n\nIt's not a long way. You are empty reeds,\n\nbut you can become sugarcane again,\n\nif you'll listen to the guide.\n\nWhen a handful of dirt was taken from the hoofprint\n\nof Gabriel's horse and thrown inside the golden calf,\n\nthe calf lowed! That's what the guide can do\n\nfor you. The guide can make you live.\n\nThe guide will take your falcon's hood off.\n\nLove is the falconer, your king.\n\nBe trained by that. Never say, or think,\n\n\"I am better than . ..whoever.\"\n\nThat's what Satan thought.\n\nSleep in the spirit tree's peaceful shade,\n\nand never stick your head out from that green."

And sG on for hours, I'm told, before televi-\n\nsion deadened the psyche, a family or a group of friends might con-\n\ntinue. Rumi was not the only poet used.

We have nothing comparable, except perhaps the nights of\n\ntrading poems back and forth that sometimes happen in gatherings.\n\nIn December of 1273 when Rumi died, representativeso f every\n\nmajor religion came to his funeral. In the midst of the crusades and\n\nviolent sectarian conflict he said, -I go into the Muslim mosque and\n\nthe Jewish synagogue and the Christian church and I see one altar.\"\n\nAnd he made it clear in other places that someone who considers reli-\n\ngion or nation an important human category is in danger of severing\n\nthe heart from its ability to act compassionately.

For such people\n\na person's presence is more to learn from\n\nthan a book. A sufi's book is not composed\n\nwith ink and alphabet. A scholar loves, and lives on,\n\nthe marks of a pen. A sufi loves footprints!\n\nHe sees those and stalks his game. At first, he sees\n\nthe clues. After a time he can follow the scent.\n\nTo go guided by fragrance is a hundred times better\n\nthan following tracks. A person who is opening\n\nto the divine is like a door to a sufi.\n\nWhat might appear a worthless stone\n\nto others, to him's a pearl. You see your image\n\nclearly in a mirror. A sheikh sees more than that\n\nin a discarded brick. Sufi masters are those\n\nwhose spirits existed before the world.\n\nBefore the body, they lived many lifetimes.\n\nBefore seeds went into the ground, they harvested wheat.\n\nBefore there was an ocean, they strung pearls.\n\nWhile the great meeting was going on about bringing\n\nhuman beings into existence, they stood up to their chins\n\nin wisdom water. When some of the angels opposed\n\ncreation, the sufi sheikhs laughed and clapped\n\namong themselves. Before materiality, they knew\n\nwhat it was like to be trapped inside matter.\n\nBefore there was a nightsky, they saw Saturn.\n\nBefore wheat grains, they tasted bread.\n\nWith no mind, they thought.\n\nImmediate intuition to them is the simplest act\n\nof consciousness, what to others would be epiphany.\n\nMuch of our thought is of the past, or the future.\n\nThey're free of those. Before a mine is dug,\n\nthey judge coins. Before vineyards,\n\nthey know the excitements to come.\n\nIn July, they feel December.\n\nIn unbroken sunlight, they find shade. In fana,\n\nthe state where all objects dissolve,\n\nthey recognize objects. The open sky drinks\n\nfrom their circling cup. The sun wears\n\nthe gold of their generosity.\n\nWhen two of them meet, they are no longer two.\n\nThey are one and six hundred thousand.\n\nThe ocean waves are their closest likeness,\n\nwhen wind makes, from unity, the numerous.\n\nThis happened to the sun, and it broke into rays\n\nthrough the window, into bodies.\n\nThe disc of the sun does exist, but if you see\n\nonly the ray-bodies, you may have doubts.\n\nThe human-divine combination is a oneness.\n\nPlurality, the apparent separation into rays.\n\nFriend, we're traveling together.\n\nThrow off your tiredness. Let me show you\n\none tiny spot of the beauty that cannot be spoken.\n\nI'm like an ant that's gotten into the granary,\n\nludicrously happy, and trying to lug out\n\na grain that's way too big."

That's how we had\n\nsuch a celebration!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you come and tell me?\"\n\n\"Several times I came near, but you were always\n\nsinging so loudly, 'The donkey's gone,\n\nthe donkey's gone,' that I thought you knew.\n\nI thought you had a secret insight.\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\nIt was my imitation of their joy that caused this.\"\n\nEven the good delight of friends is at first\n\na reflection in you. Stay with them\n\nuntil it becomes a realization.\n\nThe imitation here\n\ncame from the man's desire to be honored.\n\nIt deafened him to what was being\n\nso constantly said.\n\nRemember there's only one reason\n\nto do anything: a meeting with the Friend\n\nis the only real payment."

I hurried\n\nalong the beach toward them. The light of each\n\nlifted into the sky. I was amazed. My amazement\n\nwas amazed. Waves of bewilderment\n\nbroke over my head.\n\nWhat are these candles that no one seems to see?\n\nIn the presence of such lights people were looking\n\nfor lamps to buy!\n\nThen the seven became one,\n\nin the middle of the sky's rim.\n\nThen that\n\nfanned out to seven again. There were connections\n\nbetween the candles that cannot be said.\n\nI saw, but I cannot say.\n\nI ran closer. I fell. I lay there awhile.\n\nI got up and ran again. I had no head and no feet.\n\nThey became seven men, and then seven trees,\n\nso dense with leaves and fruit\n\nthat no limbs were visible.\n\nFlashes of light\n\nspurted from each fruit like juice!\n\nAnd most marvelous of all was that hundreds\n\nof thousands of people were passing beside the trees,\n\nrisking their lives, sacrificing everything,\n\nto find some scrap of shade.\n\nThey made peculiar parasols\n\nout of pieces of wool. They tried anything.\n\nAnd no one saw the trees with their tremendous shade!\n\nThe caravans had no food, and yet food was dropping\n\nall about them. If anyone had said,\n\n'Look! Over here!'\n\nthey would have thought him insane, or drunk.\n\nHow can this happen? Or am I dreaming?\n\nI walk up to the trees. I eat the fruit.\n\nI might as well believe.\n\nAnd still I see people\n\nsearching so desperately for an unripe grape,\n\nwith these vineyards around them,\n\nheavy with perfect bunches.\n\nThen the seven trees became one, and then seven again.\n\nAt every second they were both seven and one.\n\nThey were doing the ritual prayer, kneeling and bowing,\n\nwithout knees or waists!\n\nThen they were seven men\n\nseated in meditation for the sake of the one reality.\n\nI came closer and waved. They called,\n\n'O Daquqi,\n\nthe glory and the crown!'\n\n'How do they know my name?'\n\nI thought. 'They've never seen me till now.'\n\nImmediately they knew my thought,\n\nand smiled at each other.\n\n'Honored one,\n\nis this still hidden from you? I-low can anything\n\nbe hidden from one so dissolved in God?'\n\n'If this is the spirit-reality,' I said to myself,\n\n'how is it we're speaking words and saying names?'\n\nOne of the seven answered, 'Names, sometimes\n\nthe names slip away, but it's not forgetfulness.\n\nIt's our being so absorbed.'\n\nThen they all said to me,\n\n'Would you lead us in prayer?'\n\n'Yes. But wait awhile.\n\nI am still in some temporal confusion\n\nthat will be solved by companionship with you.\n\nThrough companionship with the ground a grapevine\n\ngrows. It opens into the earth's darkness\n\nand flies. It becomes selfless\n\nin the presence of its origin and learns\n\nwhat it really is.'\n\nThey nodded, as though saying,\n\n'Whenever you're ready.' That nodding\n\nwas a flame in my heart.\n\nI was freed from hourly time,\n\nfrom sequence and relation.\"\n\nEveryone has a stable\n\nand a trainer appointed to him or her. If you break away,\n\nthe trainer comes and gets you. You think\n\nyou're making choices, but the trainer is actually\n\nleading you around.\n\nYou like to deny\n\nthat you have a keeper.

    "chapter_title": "The Turn: Dance in Your Blood",
    "chapter_intro": "The \"turn,\" the moving meditation done by MevIevi dervishes, origi-\n\nnated with Rumi. The story goes that he was walking in the gold-\n\nsmithing section of Konya when he heard a beautiful music in their\n\nhammering. He began turning in harmony with it, an ecstatic dance\n\nof surrender and yet with great centered discipline. He arrived at a\n\nplace where ego dissolves and a resonance with universal soul comes\n\nin. Dervish literally means \"doorway.\" When what is communicated\n\nmoves from presence to presence, darshan occurs, with language in-\n\nside the seeing. When the gravitationalp ull gets even stronger, the\n\ntwo become one turning that is molecular and galactic and a spiritual\n\nremembering of the presence at the center of the universe. Turning is\n\nan image of how the dervish becomes an empty place where human\n\nand divine can meet. To approach the whole the part must become\n\nmad, by conventional standardsa t least. These ecstatic holy people,\n\ncalled matzubs in the sufi tradition, redefine this sort of madness as\n\ntrue health.\n\nWhen he saw the dervishes in Cairo in 9rg1o, Rainer Maria Rilke,\n\nthe great spiritualp oet of this century, said the turn was a form of\n\nkneeling. \"It is so truly the mystery of the kneeling of the deeply\n\nkneeling man. With Rumi the scale is shifted, for in following the\n\npeculiar weight and strength in his knees, he belongs to that world\n\nin which height is depth. This is the night of radiantd epth unfolded.\"\n\nDecember I7 is celebrated each year as Rumi's Wedding Night, the\n\nnight he died in 1273 and reached full union.\n\n\n\nInside water, a waterwheel turns.\n\nA star circulates with the moon.\n\nWe live in the night ocean wondering,\n\nWhat are these lights?\n\n\n\nYou have said what you are.\n\nI am what I am.\n\nYour actions in my head,\n\nmy head here in my hands\n\nwith something circling inside.\n\nI have no name\n\nfor what circles\n\nso perfectly.\n\n\n\nA secret turning in us\n\nmakes the universe turn.\n\nHead unaware of feet,\n\nand feet head. Neither cares.\n\nThey keep turning.\n\n\n\nThis moment this love comes to rest in me,\n\nmany beings in one being.\n\nIn one wheat grain a thousand sheaf stacks.\n\nInside the needle's eye a turning night of stars.\n\n\n\nKeep walking, though there's no place to get to.\n\nDon't try to see through the distances.\n\nThat's not for human beings. Move within,\n\nbut don't move the way fear makes you move.\n\n\n\nWalk to the well.\n\nTurn as the earth and the moon turn,\n\ncircling what they love.\n\nWhatever circles comes from the center.\n\n\n\nI circle your nest tonight,\n\naround and around until morning\n\nwhen a breath of air says, Now,\n\nand the Friend holds up like a goblet\n\nsome anonymous skull.\n\n\n\nNo better love than love with no object,\n\nno more satisfying work than work with no purpose.\n\nIf you could give up tricks and cleverness,\n\nthat would be the cleverest trick!\n\n\n\nSome nights stay up till dawn,\n\nas the moon sometimes does for the sun.\n\nBe a full bucket pulled up the dark way\n\nof a well, then lifted out into light.\n\n\n\nI am so small I can barely be seen.\n\nHow can this great love be inside me?\n\nLook at your eyes. They are small,\n\nbut they see enormous things.\n\n\n\nWhen you feel your lips becoming infinite\n\nand sweet, like the moon in a sky,\n\nwhen you feel that spaciousness inside,\n\nShams of Tabriz will be there too.\n\n\n\nThe sun is love. The lover,\n\na speck circling the sun.\n\nA Spring wind moves to dance\n\nany branch that isn't dead.\n\n\n\nSomething opens our wings.
